Dear Me, with FNS in a world that wants to understand or fix everything
(Letters from a body that is failing and a heart that refuses to give up)


Foreword


They said: 'It's all in your head.'
As if that would make it less serious.
As if your head isn't part of your body.
As if your brain can't crash from overload, trauma, or just... bad luck.

And suddenly there's a label. A diagnosis. FNS.
Functional Neurological Syndrome.
It sounds clinically neat.
But it doesn't feel that way.

Not for me (yet), anyway.


It feels like there's a short circuit in your nervous system.
As if someone has fixed your wiring with duct tape and paper clips -
and every time you think: now it's working again,
something else fails.

Sometimes it's your leg.
Sometimes your speech.
Sometimes your concentration, your balance, or your confidence in your own body.
Sometimes it's double or blurred vision. Or temporarily not being able to see anything at all. Difficulty swallowing - or suddenly choking for no reason.
Slowed thinking. Information that doesn't come through, or sticks in my mind like sludge.
Sometimes tremors in your body. Paralysis.
Loss of strength in your arm, your leg - or both.
And in the meantime: sounds that come in far too loud, lights that cut,
a supermarket that feels like a maze full of sirens and unexpected obstacles.
On top of that, a fatigue that cannot be solved by 'a good night's sleep'.
And on some days... everything fails you at once.

And the outside world?
They don't see anything.
Or they think you're exaggerating. Or that you "need to think more positively". Or "just do something fun".
As if positivity and distraction are the off switch for your complaints – well-intentioned, of course.

It is there.
In your head.
In your left hand that suddenly doesn't work anymore.
In the fear of not being taken seriously.
In your legs, which sometimes don't know if they'll cooperate today.
As if you've lost control of your own body.
Even though you're trying so damn hard to stay on your feet.

I'm writing this book because I'm tired of explaining.
Because I'm done with the looks of doubt.
And because I know how it feels to dance on a good day,
and then almost feel guilty afterwards -
as if laughing invalidates FNS.

This book is not a manual. Not a solution. Not a plea for pity.
It is a collection of letters.
Raw. Loving. Uncomfortably honest.
Sometimes with humour, sometimes with tears.

Letters to myself. To other people with FNS.
To doctors, civil servants, social workers, family, friends, neighbours —
to anyone who may not know what FNS is,
but is willing to listen.

Because FNS is not "all in your head".
But it is there.

So I write.
Because words can open things up.
Like light shining through a crack in the door.
Not to understand or fix everything, but to finally see it for what it really is.

Letters that make FNS just that little bit more visible – that's my hope.
For you. For me.
For that one family member, friend, doctor or civil servant who still thinks it's not that bad.
And for those – including myself – who don't quite understand yet.
Because that says more about this condition than about the person living with it.

For everyone who lives with a body that sometimes doesn't cooperate –
and a heart that refuses to give up.

Welcome.
You are not alone.





Letter 1

Disconnected
(My first signs of FNS)


Dear Me,

My body knew before I did.
A tremor that I quickly dismissed.
A leg that suddenly started to drag.
Eyes that became blurry, as if my gaze was withdrawing from the world.
And somewhere inside – that little voice: 'Something's not right.'

I kept going. Of course.
Gritting my teeth, because what else could I do?
I didn't want to be difficult or weak.
I really didn't have time for that.


I thought: maybe it will pass.
Maybe it's just stress. Or lack of sleep.
Or grief. Or overstimulation.
Or my imagination.

But then, more and more often:
words that wouldn't come,
a body that wouldn't follow,
a head that emptied or froze – sometimes all at once.
I thought: 'What is this?'
And even though I didn't understand it myself, I also wondered: how can I expect anyone else to understand?

While my world was slowly shrinking,
the outside world was still in full swing.
There was chatting, laughing, cycling, dancing -
normal life going on, which I so wanted to be a part of.
The world was deaf to what was standing still inside me.

As if nothing was wrong.
And I watched -
half present,
half absent.
With a body that betrayed me.
With a mind that let me down.

They asked, 'What's wrong with you?
I shrugged my shoulders. I didn't know.
That ignorance ate away at me inside.
Because if I couldn't explain it myself,
how could anyone else understand that something was really wrong with me?

I felt lost in my own nervous system.
As if the connections had suddenly changed,
as if the power had gone out.
In places where I desperately needed it.
I wanted to, but I couldn't.
And that "not being able" felt like failure -
even though it wasn't my fault.

And in the meantime, I had to function.
Act normal. Participate.
They still needed me — family, friends, life going on.
I wanted to be there for them, even though it completely drained me.
Every time I fell back, but I couldn't help it.
I dragged myself along, spoke words that my body didn't follow,
tried to pretend I was whole — while inside everything was breaking.
While my body screamed out.
Or said nothing at all.

On those grey days when everything came to a standstill, taking good care of myself was already quite an achievement.
Taking a shower felt like a difficult task without the right tools.
Making a phone call felt like talking through a thick fog where words get lost.
Making a decent breakfast seemed like an impossible mission.

I started to withdraw.
Because explaining took too much effort.
And the looks of incomprehension cut too deep.
As if I was making it up.
As if I was too sensitive.
As if I was putting on an act.

So I fell silent.
And in that silence, loneliness grew.
Not because I was alone,
but because no one could really reach me.

And yet here I am.
Still.

I write.
Because I need words that create space.
For myself. For others.
Because I know: if I'm going through this, I'm not the only one.
And if one person feels a little more seen after reading this letter,
then it won't have been for nothing.

I am not my complaint.
Not my label. Not my limitation.
I am so much more.

So I keep writing.
For the part of me that always carried on.
For the part of me that whispered: don't give up.
For that stubborn part of me that, despite everything, believes that love and compassion are stronger than body and mind in revolt.

I am allowed to be here.

Love,
Your searching, silently discovering self

The day it got a name
(Relief, confusion and the struggle to accept)


Dear Self,

The diagnosis came on 31 December 2024, at exactly 2:30 p.m.
Not exactly a festive end to the year – but then again, holidays are for people who don't constantly doubt their own bodies, which can let you down at any moment.
I sat in the waiting room, full of confusion, and went home even more confused.

At first, I was relieved: it wasn't MS.
Something recognisable, something with a name.
But that relief quickly gave way to even more confusion.
And resistance.
And a flood of questions without answers.

FNS. Functional Neurological Syndrome.
Sounds like a technical malfunction in a complicated machine.
Something that happens to your body without a clear cause or cure.

How do you explain that to yourself? Who the fuck ordered this? Where's the complaints line? The manual? And will I get compensation points for it at the karma desk?

And how do you explain FNS to a world that clings to diagnoses with hard results?
In a world that seeks reassurance in facts and clear answers, it is almost impossible to understand what I am going through.
How do you explain that something is so tangibly real, even though there is no measurable evidence for it?
That my body and mind are stuck, with no reset button, switch or key to restart it.

That makes it lonely.
Because it seems like everyone is waiting for a label, a result, something concrete they can hold on to.
But my reality cannot be captured in numbers.

So I live between two worlds:
The visible one, where everything has to be logical and clear -
and the invisible one, where my body struggles without anyone seeing it.

And yet I continue to hope that understanding begins with listening,
with really seeing and making room for what cannot be measured.
Because FNS is a diagnosis that makes sense on paper,
but in practice makes you feel uncertain
and repeatedly encounters incomprehension.

That diagnosis did not end my confusion.
Instead, it opened a new chapter of questions, fear and resistance.

They said, 'It's not psychological.'
But my head was full of doubts and fear.
As if I were trying to tame a hurricane of emotions and uncertainties -
without a compass or anchor.
As if I were the only one who had doubts,
and at the same time was abandoned by everyone who did not.

I wanted to get a grip on what was happening.
But it felt like I was trying to solve a puzzle in the dark.
With pieces that didn't fit,
and an image that never became complete.

The diagnosis gave me a name, an explanation.
But accepting it? That took time.
It was a struggle, a battle between hope and despair.
Between wanting to believe that things will get better
and being afraid that they never will.

And here I am now.
With that diagnosis as a starting point, not a final destination.

So I write.
To share what it means to live with something I don't yet fully understand,
but am trying to find my way in.

Because I know I'm not the only one.

Love,
Your vulnerable and slowly accepting self

When natural was no longer natural
(About the loss of everyday movement, and how something small can suddenly turn everything upside down)


Dear Me,

It's strange how loss sometimes doesn't announce itself with blaring sirens, but creeps into your body. How something that always came naturally suddenly encounters resistance. Not with a lot of pain, not with blood - but with silent resistance. As if your body has started following a secret agenda without your permission.

I used to just take one step, and then another, without thinking.
Running without brakes, just moving forward, dancing until dawn,
and just carrying on - into the day, without stopping.
My legs cooperated,
my brain followed faithfully,
like a silent stream, always present, always along for the ride.

Until they stopped.

I remember it well. That morning when I got up and my right leg felt like an erased sketch. As if my body had drawn a leg but forgotten to colour it in. I hobbled across the room, trying to ignore it. Cup of coffee, washing machine on, straighten my back — because I had to.

Maybe that was the hardest part. Not that I suddenly couldn't do as much. But that I didn't want to show it.

So I carried on.
Sometimes I walked crookedly, but I smiled straight.
I said, 'I'm fine,' while moving my foot under the table to check if it was still there.

And no one noticed. Even I didn't want to see it.

Perhaps I no longer recognised myself - in that body that no longer functioned on its own.
I felt betrayed. As if my body had abandoned me just when I needed it most.
But somewhere, deep down, I knew: maybe it wasn't betrayal, but a last attempt to be heard.
Not a surrender, but a signal.
Maybe my body wasn't asking me to fight, but to finally listen.
I now understand why I kept it hidden for so long. As soon as you make something visible, it suddenly becomes real. And then often follows silence. The comment: "But you look fine, don't you?" Or the question: "Are you ill again?"

I became a master of masks.
Smiled on Instagram.
Said yes to invitations, but made up excuses on the way.
Deleted words from my vocabulary: exhaustion, overstimulation, help.
And replaced them with: busy busy busy, it is what it is, I'm fine.

There was a moment when I was standing at a party laughing while my left foot was completely numb. I held my drink in the air, made a joke, and meanwhile thought: I hope no one sees that I'm leaning on the bar stool as if it were a walker.

But it eats away at you.
At your energy.
At your self-image.
At your courage.

Because how can you fight when your own body has already raised the white flag?
How can you trust in tomorrow when today already feels like a marathon without a warm-up?

And yet.

Yet there is something that does not break.

A glimmer that remains.
Sometimes in the loving gaze of a friend who does see what you are hiding.
Or in the small moment when you give yourself permission to rest without guilt.

Slowly, I am learning that rest is not a surrender, but an act of love.
That not being able to do something anymore doesn't mean you are nothing anymore.
That my value is not in speed, but in presence.
In how I keep looking for ways to be gentle, even when everything is screaming.

Perhaps you recognise this too. Or do you recognise it in your loved one, a colleague or a mother in the school playground who has... what's it called again? FNS?
That your body sets your limits before your head realises it.
Then know this: you don't have to prove anything.
You are already brave enough.

Love,
My brave, gentle self

Caps, Breaks & Priorities
(About surviving, making choices and 'Learning to pause without guilt')


Dear me,

Some days I wake up with plans, hope, lipstick.
Other days with... a Nike baseball cap on my head.
Or the choice is made for me out of necessity.
I stay in bed.
My body refuses what I ask of it.
My mind clings to what was once taken for granted.


There are mornings when even brushing my teeth feels like my arms have to lift a heavy load, jerky and endless.

The simplest things — washing my hair, answering an email, having a conversation — sometimes feel like a tangle of wires that just won't come together, no matter how hard I pull.

And so I learn to choose.

I learn to prioritise like an accomplished crisis manager. Not because I want to, but because I have to. Today: cook, leave the vacuum cleaner alone. Or go for a walk, but no phone calls.
Or: oversized sunglasses, Nike baseball cap and lipstick – the holy trinity of my FNS survival kit.

I even wear those sunglasses on rainy days. Not to look hip, but to tolerate the light that fries my nervous system. And that cap? Sometimes for my unwashed hair, sometimes as pure camouflage. Sometimes against stimuli, sometimes against people.

I'm getting good at it, almost creative. I come up with tricks, band-aids, ways to make life with FNS just a little more bearable.

Some days are better than others.

My brain sometimes repeats signals like a damaged LP under a blunt needle. Or the signals don't come through, resulting in blackouts or overstimulation. Patience is a virtue in those moments. That inner noise, that continuous reset without end – that is the most exhausting thing of all. And on top of that, there is an exhaustion that really cannot be solved with the best will in the world.

I keep explaining.

To people who mean well, really –
But comments like, 'Yes, I get tired sometimes too'
hurt, because they don't see the difference.
My fatigue means that on some days, even with the best will in the world, I can't even take care of myself a little bit normally.

And yet... I keep showing up.

For myself.
For life.
At my own pace.

I have balls, even if you can't see them on an MRI.
FNS forces me to be honest. To say no more often, without feeling guilty. To let go of what I can no longer carry.
To make choices: a cap instead of clean hair. Silence instead of explanation.

And that's okay.

I'm not lazy. I work hard to survive.
To recover. To adapt. To accept.
That takes more courage than anyone can see.

Finally, I want to give you a gentle invitation, dear Me:
Be kind to yourself - even if it means being out of action for a few days or weeks, with a dose of guilt, sadness and frustration.
It's okay to feel, to pause, and to accept that some days are just harder than others.
And it is precisely that gentleness that can help you find strength again, to get back up and keep going.

So when I look in the mirror again later - with my cap and sunglasses -
I know: I'm actually doing f*cking well.

And tomorrow? Tomorrow I'll see.

Love,
Your growing self, who doesn't give up easily

Boundaries & Breathing Space
(About the moment when I learn to listen, let go and protect myself)


Dear Self,

There are days when the world pulls at me.
So many voices, expectations, faces.
And I feel my body recoiling a little further each time.

Not because I don't want to.
But because I can't.
So I start listening – to the echoes in my body.
To the signals I've ignored for too long.
To the quiet, clear language of overstimulation, breakdown and exhaustion.

I am learning not only to recognise boundaries,
but also to protect them.
Without explanation, without excuse, without criticising myself.

No is not a wall.
It is a form of love.

Sometimes that means:
Putting my phone on silent.
Rescheduling an appointment.
Doing nothing for a day without punishing myself for it.

I don't choose out of convenience,
but out of necessity.
And that takes courage.

I am learning to no longer measure myself against others.
My day is not a competition. My pace is not a failure.
What is rest for someone else
is recovery for me.

I don't have to prove myself to earn my right to exist.
I don't have to get better to be valuable.


Sometimes I feel like a balloon -
kept inflated by all the "musts".
Sometimes that works out well. Often it doesn't.
But little by little, I let the air escape.
Gently. Steadily.
Until I take on my own shape again.
Not inflated, but real.

Today, I am allowed to just be.
With everything that is.
With everything that doesn't work out.

And when I look in the mirror again -
without masks, without pretensions -
I see someone who is working hard on gentleness.
On healing.
On acceptance.
On being true to myself.

And that is more than enough.

Love,
Your wise, confused, incorrigible Self
